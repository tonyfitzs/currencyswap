Create a 3-step onboarding flow for the Convertr app:

Step 1: Ask for home country.
- Title: "Where’s home for you?"
- Searchable input field with:
  - Country name
  - ISO 3-letter code (e.g., AUS)
  - Currency code (e.g., AUD)
- Filter the list in real time based on input
- Show country name, flag, and currency code
- Store as: homeCurrencyCountry

Step 2: Ask for geolocation permission.
- Title: "Allow location access?"
- Message: "To show you accurate prices wherever you go, we need to access your location."
- Button: “Allow”
- If denied: Show message: "Convertr requires location to function. Please enable it in your settings."
- Store result, don't ask again unless user changes settings
- Make it a required permission

Step 3: Ask how to display currency.
- Title: "How do you want to display currencies?"
- Options:
  - Symbols (e.g. $, €, ¥)
  - 3-letter codes (e.g. USD, EUR, JPY)
- Required selection
- Store as: displayPreference ("symbol" or "code")

After setup, proceed to main UI.
